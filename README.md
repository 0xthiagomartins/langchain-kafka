The goal of this project is to create a microsservice using kafka that wrapps every langchain runnables and provides a client interface to access the runnables feature through a kafka message broker.

It must be able to call the methods invoke, batch and stream.

for tests we will going to use pytest

### Project Requirements

#### 1. **Kafka Integration**
- **Setup Kafka Cluster**
  - Install and configure Kafka brokers.
  - Set up ZooKeeper if required.
- **Producers and Consumers**
  - Implement Kafka producers to send messages to specific topics.
  - Implement Kafka consumers to listen and process messages from topics.
- **Topic Configuration**
  - Define and create topics for different functionalities (e.g., invoke, batch, stream).

#### 2. **Langchain Runnable Wrappers**
- **Identify Runnables**
  - List all Langchain runnables that need to be wrapped.
- **Wrapper Implementation**
  - Create wrapper classes or functions for each runnable.
  - Ensure wrappers can handle `invoke`, `batch`, and `stream` methods.
- **Error Handling**
  - Implement robust error handling within wrappers to manage exceptions and retries.

#### 3. **Client Interface**
- **API Design**
  - Design RESTful or gRPC APIs for client interactions.
  - Ensure APIs can send messages via Kafka to access runnable features.
- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Implement security measures to authenticate and authorize client requests.
- **Documentation**
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation for client developers.

#### 4. **Messaging Protocol**
- **Message Schema**
  - Define clear schemas for request and response messages.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**
  - Choose and implement serialization formats (e.g., JSON, Avro).
- **Message Validation**
  - Validate incoming and outgoing messages to ensure data integrity.

#### 5. **Testing**
- **Unit Testing**
  - Write unit tests for individual components using pytest.
- **Integration Testing**
  - Test interactions between Kafka, wrappers, and client interface.
- **Mocking External Services**
  - Use mocks for Kafka and Langchain components to simulate real interactions.

#### 6. **Deployment**
- **Containerization**
  - Dockerize the microservice for consistent deployment environments.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Implement monitoring tools to track service health.
  - Set up centralized logging for troubleshooting and analysis.

### Development Roadmap

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
- Initialize the project repository and version control.
- Set up the development environment with necessary dependencies.
- Configure Kafka cluster locally or on a chosen platform.

#### **Phase 2: Kafka Integration**
- Implement basic Kafka producer and consumer.
- Create and configure necessary Kafka topics.
- Test message flow between producer and consumer.

#### **Phase 3: Langchain Wrappers Development**
- Identify all required Langchain runnables.
- Develop and test wrappers for each runnable with `invoke` method.
- Extend wrappers to support `batch` and `stream` methods.

#### **Phase 4: Client Interface Implementation**
- Design API endpoints for client interactions.
- Implement API routes to handle `invoke`, `batch`, and `stream` requests.
- Integrate API with Kafka producers to send messages.

#### **Phase 5: Messaging Protocol Definition**
- Define and document message schemas.
- Implement serialization and deserialization logic.
- Ensure message validation is in place.

#### **Phase 6: Testing**
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all components.
- Develop integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between components.
- Perform load testing to evaluate performance under stress.

#### **Phase 7: Deployment Preparation**
- Dockerize the microservice.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Configure monitoring and logging tools.

#### **Phase 8: Deployment and Monitoring**
- Deploy the microservice to the production environment.
- Monitor service performance and health.
- Iterate on feedback and make necessary improvements.
